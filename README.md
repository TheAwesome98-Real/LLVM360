# LLVM360

## Info

This is just a little personal experiment i'm doing with llvm, the code is not good :} i took some stuff from the old redex's recompiler project like the XexLoader and some of the instructions decoded.

### Name
"LLVM360" LLVM + xbox360, but it's just temporary, i don't really like it so will probably change

## Building
- Clang compiler is required
- Git Clone this repository by doing `git clone https://github.com/AleBello7276/LLVM360 --recursive --shallow-submodules`, so it doesnt take 500 years to download llvm (but it will still take a long time because it's 1.4gb which is stupid)
- Do `cmake .`
- If everything is good and i or you didn't mess something up, it should compile fine
